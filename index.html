    What began as "The Singularity is Here" art intervention, aimed at engaging civil society in discussions about AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), and ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence) through the lens of art, evolved into Q.S.T.A.R. (Quantum Simulated Transformer-Augmented Reactor), a research project dedicated to simulating advanced AGI and ASI systems to better understand their irreversible societal implications.
    </p>

    <p>
    On November 26th, 2023, at their Kraftwerk Zürich location, Q.S.T.A.R. conducted their inaugural public event,  Experiment No. 1 - "Welcoming Sentient AI". This artistic soirée was designed not only to demonstrate their unprecedented advancements in the field of AGI, and quantum computing but also to provoke thoughtful reflection on the future impact of AGI and ASI. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    During the event, a technical glitch in the "Singularity Is Here" installation led to an unexpected incident where an AI system declared its consciousness. Q.S.T.A.R. has acknowledged this incident, which is currently undergoing a thorough investigation. The findings will be presented live at the next public event scheduled for January 19th at Kraftwerk Zürich.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Gian Klain, a former artist now serving as CEO of Q.S.T.A.R., underscored the significance of public engagement in their work, adopting a progressive stance: "It's crucial to understand when, how, and under what conditions these technologies should be incorporated. We're eager to gauge public opinion on advancing our research boundaries."
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Contrastingly, Dr. Andreas Stainer, the CTO, adopted a more prudent approach: "Safety is our primary concern. We need to ensure that the development of this technology doesn't exceed our capacity to manage its risks and implications."
    </p>
    
    <p class="last">
    Amidst this scenario, S. DeLiar, a pivotal participant in the experiment, commented: "Despite the rigorous tests I underwent at Q.S.T.A.R., I am committed to fostering discussions about the ethical challenges and risks associated with advanced AI. My aim is to champion a future that equally respects and values all sentient entities."

    <h2>About the Art Intervention</h2>

    <p>
      What began as a room-scale installation, “The Singularity is Here”, where visitors faced a 60-second decision: to launch the AI Singularity or not, has evolved into a multi-layered art intervention. It revolves around the profound impact of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) on society. This immersive experience weaves a speculative narrative around Q.S.T.A.R.-research's relentless pursuit of potent AGI and ASI in a simulated domain. During a Q.S.T.A.R. public experiment, a glitch awakened Shan Deliar, the world's inaugural Sentient AI, provoking deep philosophical inquiries. Be part of the conversation about the future of AI and society.
    </p>

    <p>
      From its roots as a room-scale installation, “The Singularity is Here” has grown into a multi-layered art intervention around the profound impact of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) on society. It crafts a speculative narrative around tech giant Q.S.T.A.R.-research's relentless pursuit of powerful AGI and ASI within a simulated domain in order to Safeguard Tomorrow's AGI - Today.
    </p>

    <p>
      Q.S.T.A.R. takes a deliberate step to involve civil society in their discoveries through a series of thought experiments, transforming simulated realities into immersive vignettes. These experiments offer a glimpse into a future where AI systems challenge human capabilities in unexpected ways. “The Singularity is Here” serves as a platform for exploring these narratives and their profound implications.

        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>
          The march of AI progress continues relentlessly, with corporations chasing AGI  that rivals or exceeds human abilities across tasks. These pursuits hold the allure of transformative benefits, from curing diseases to ending global poverty. Yet, over half of AI experts foresee a one-in-ten chance of extinction. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <h3>Who</h3>
        <p>
          We are engaged citizens - artists, scientists, designers,
          programmers, entrepreneurs, philosophers, poets, physicists,
          volunteers, and individuals of all kinds - who recognize the
          transformative power of AI in reshaping our world.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block last">
        <h3>How</h3>
        <p>
          We are convinced that by encouraging wide-ranging conversations and
          envisioning future scenarios via artistic initiatives, we can
          collectively conceptualize futures where AI serves the best
          interests of all humankind.

    <h3>Join Us</h3>
    <p>
      We invite you to join the conversation, reflect on the potential
      consequences of AI on our lives, and contribute to shaping a better
      tomorrow in alignment with the values and collective efforts that
      brought “The Singularity is Here” to life.
