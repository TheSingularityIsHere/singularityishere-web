  <h2>About the Art Intervention</h2>

  <p>
    "The Singularity is Here" is a
    multilayered art intervention where visitors have 60 seconds to decide
    whether to launch the Singularity or not, initiating critical
    discussions about the far-reaching consequences of artificial
    intelligence (AI) on society.
  </p>

  <p>
    The installation serves as a reminder of the existential threats we face
    without proper frameworks in place and calls for stronger regulations to
    ensure the safe advancement of exponential technologies.

      <h2>Why</h2>
      <p>
        We envision a future where ethical principles and human values guide

        involvement in shaping the ethical and regulatory frameworks
        governing AI.
