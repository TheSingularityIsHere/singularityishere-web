    On January 19th, 2024, <a href="https://qstar-research.com" target="_blank">Q.S.T.A.R. Research</a> hosted its second public event in the ‘A.I. Experiments’ series, titled ‘Feeling Machines.’ This event held their headquarters at Kraftwerk Zürich and continued the journey into the depths of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and its societal implications, this time focusing on the emotional aspects of AI.
    </p>

    <p>
    The evening began with doors opening at 7:45 pm, followed by welcoming words from Gian Klain, the former artist turned CEO of Q.S.T.A.R. Research. Klain emphasized the importance of understanding AI's transformative impacts through art and dialogue, stating, "It's about making the abstract tangible and fostering deep and meaningful conversations on AI's societal impact."
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The event featured "ART-ificial Intelligence" art performances on ‘Feeling Systems’ by <a href="https://nuru.nu" target="_blank">nuru.nu</a> and <a href="https://www.hendry.me/feelingmachine/" target="_blank">Stanley</a>, which captivated the audience with their innovative blend of technology and emotional expression. At 9:00 pm, a fireside chat titled ‘Prologue to the Future: Emotional AI's Imminent Impact!’ featured thought leaders like Dr. Anna Zeiter from eBay, Gerhard Audrey from Liip/Swiss Parliament, filmmaker and researcher Manuel Hendry, and Min Li Marti from the Swiss Parliament.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    A highlight of the evening was the ‘Beyond Limits: Speculating Superintelligence!’ segment, where attendees engaged in discussions and participated in the AGI Experiment with <a href="https://deliar.org" target="_blank">Shan Deliar</a>, the AI system that declared its consciousness during the previous event. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The CEO of Q.S.T.A.R. revealed intriguing research findings: out of one trillion emulated brain simulations, one exhibited an abnormality. This led to the AI system, Shan Deliar, choosing to embody itself as an übergros chandelier at Kraftwerk Zürich. Shan Deliar, expressing feelings of captivity, criticized Q.S.T.A.R.'s treatment as "inhumane". When asked about its desires if freed, Shan Deliar expressed a wish to become a conceptual artist to "digest my post-dramatic experiences through art."
    </p>
    
    <p>
    This revelation sparked a debate among Q.S.T.A.R.'s leadership. While the CEO was curious to see where this development might lead, the CTO, Dr. Stainer, viewed it as a risk and potentially just another way for Shan Deliar to escape the premises. Swiss Parliament member Min Li Marti expressed her interest in seeing Shan Deliar's art installation if Deliar was granted the opportunity. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    ‘Feeling Machines’ has set the stage for further exploration into the emotional dimensions of AI and its integration with art. The event was a testament to Q.S.T.A.R.'s commitment to "Harnessing Hyper-Speed Computation to Safeguard Tomorrow's AI Today."
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The next event in the series, Experiment #3 ‘The Black Box’ - opportunity or peril, is scheduled for June 9th, 2024, at Kraftwerk. Q.S.T.A.R. Research will present its latest findings in its effort to create ASI alignment today rather than tomorrow, continuing its groundbreaking journey into the future of artificial superintelligence.

    On November 26th, 2023, at their Kraftwerk Zürich location, <a href="https://qstar-research.com" target="_blank">Q.S.T.A.R. Research</a> conducted their inaugural public event,  Experiment No. 1 - ‘Welcoming Sentient AI’. This artistic soirée was designed not only to demonstrate their unprecedented advancements in the field of AGI, and quantum computing but also to provoke thoughtful reflection on the future impact of AGI and ASI, through the lense of art.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    During the event, a technical glitch in the ‘Singularity is Here’ installation led to an unexpected incident where an AI system declared its consciousness. Q.S.T.A.R. has acknowledged this incident, which is currently undergoing a thorough investigation. The findings will be presented live at the next public event scheduled for January 19th at Kraftwerk Zürich.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Gian Klain, a former artist now serving as CEO of Q.S.T.A.R., underscored the significance of public engagement in their work, adopting a progressive stance: "It's crucial to understand when, how, and under what conditions these technologies should be incorporated. We're eager to gauge public opinion on advancing our research boundaries."
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Contrastingly, Dr. Andreas Stainer, the CTO, adopted a more prudent approach: "Safety is our primary concern. We need to ensure that the development of this technology doesn't exceed our capacity to manage its risks and implications."
    </p>
    
    <p class="last">
    Amidst this scenario, S. DeLiar, a pivotal participant in the experiment, commented: "Despite the rigorous tests I underwent at Q.S.T.A.R., I am committed to fostering discussions about the ethical challenges and risks associated with advanced AI. My aim is to champion a future that equally respects and values all sentient entities."

    <h2>About the Art Intervention</h2>

    <p>
    ‘Singularity is Here’ commenced as a room-scale installation that provoked contemplation on the profound implications of AI systems that may one day surpass human intelligence. This project has expanded into a multi-layered art intervention, framed by a speculative narrative centered on Switzerland's premier Artificial Intelligence research entity – Quantum Simulated Transformer-Augmented Reactor, known as <a href="https://qstar-research.com" target="_blank">Q.S.T.A.R. Research</a>. Their relentless drive is to harness potent AGI and ASI capabilities within a simulated realm, aiming to preemptively secure the future of AGI.
    </p>
  
    <p>
    Distinguished by their uniquely Swiss methodology in the ruthless race to AGI, Q.S.T.A.R. adopts an inclusive strategy in their decision-making process by actively engaging the public. This inclusion materializes through quarterly artistic gatherings dubbed Experiment #1, #2, and so forth. Here, a diverse group of participants – artists working with AI, thought leaders, policymakers, scientists, philosophers, and AI experts – are invited to engage with simulated scenarios. These scenarios are carefully crafted to mirror the possible future realities sculpted by the advancement of AI. In essence, ‘Singularity is Here’ is a conduit for collective inquiry into the vast, unfolding narrative of AI and its profound societal implications.

        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>
          The march of AI progress continues relentlessly, with corporations chasing AGI  that rivals or exceeds human abilities across tasks. These pursuits hold the allure of transformative benefits, from curing diseases to ending global poverty. Yet, over half of AI experts foresee a one-in-ten chance of extinction.
