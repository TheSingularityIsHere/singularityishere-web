      <h3>
        Today, May 23rd, 2023, marks the launch of "The Singularity is Here", a
        multilayered art intervention where visitors have 60 seconds to decide
        whether to launch the Singularity or not, initiating critical
        discussions about the far-reaching consequences of artificial
        intelligence (AI) on society.

      <h3>
        The installation serves as a reminder of the existential threats we face
        without proper frameworks in place and calls for stronger regulations to
        ensure the safe advancement of exponential technologies.

            governing AI.
