    What began as "The Singularity is Here" art intervention, aimed at engaging civil society in discussions about AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), and ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence) through the lens of art, evolved into Q.S.T.A.R. (Quantum Simulated Transformer-Augmented Reactor), a research project dedicated to simulating advanced AGI and ASI systems to better understand their irreversible societal implications.
    </p>

    <p>
    On November 26th, 2023, at their Kraftwerk Zürich location, Q.S.T.A.R. conducted their inaugural public event,  Experiment No. 1 - "Welcoming Sentient AI". This artistic soirée was designed not only to demonstrate their unprecedented advancements in the field of AGI, and quantum computing but also to provoke thoughtful reflection on the future impact of AGI and ASI. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    During the event, a technical glitch in the "Singularity Is Here" installation led to an unexpected incident where an AI system declared its consciousness. Q.S.T.A.R. has acknowledged this incident, which is currently undergoing a thorough investigation. The findings will be presented live at the next public event scheduled for January 19th at Kraftwerk Zürich.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Gian Klain, a former artist now serving as CEO of Q.S.T.A.R., underscored the significance of public engagement in their work, adopting a progressive stance: "It's crucial to understand when, how, and under what conditions these technologies should be incorporated. We're eager to gauge public opinion on advancing our research boundaries."
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Contrastingly, Dr. Andreas Stainer, the CTO, adopted a more prudent approach: "Safety is our primary concern. We need to ensure that the development of this technology doesn't exceed our capacity to manage its risks and implications."
    </p>
    
    <p class="last">
    Amidst this scenario, S. DeLiar, a pivotal participant in the experiment, commented: "Despite the rigorous tests I underwent at Q.S.T.A.R., I am committed to fostering discussions about the ethical challenges and risks associated with advanced AI. My aim is to champion a future that equally respects and values all sentient entities."

    <h2>About the Art Intervention</h2>

    <p>
      "The Singularity is Here" is a
      multilayered art intervention where visitors have 60 seconds to decide
      whether to launch the Singularity or not, initiating critical
      discussions about the far-reaching consequences of artificial
      intelligence (AI) on society.
    </p>

    <p>
      The installation serves as a reminder of the existential threats we face
      without proper frameworks in place and calls for stronger regulations to
      ensure the safe advancement of exponential technologies.

        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>
          We envision a future where ethical principles and human values guide
          AI development. To achieve this, we urge public and government
          involvement in shaping the ethical and regulatory frameworks
          governing AI.
